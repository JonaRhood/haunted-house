# 👻 Haunted House – Three.js Journey

This is a project built as part of the **Three.js Journey** course by [Bruno Simon](https://threejs-journey.com/).  
The goal was to create an interactive 3D **haunted house** scene with lights, shadows, spooky elements, and atmospheric effects.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Three.js** – The main 3D library used to render the haunted house scene in the browser.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – For scene logic, interactivity, animations, and controls.
- **Vite** – A fast and modern development build tool for serving and bundling the project.
- **lil.GUI** – A lightweight UI for tweaking parameters in real time (e.g., lights, fog).
- **Textures** – Custom textures used for materials like bricks, grass, doors, etc.

## 🏗️ Features

- 3D haunted house with spooky atmosphere
- Real-time shadows and lighting (point, ambient, directional lights)
- Fog effects and animated ghosts
- Textured materials for realism
- Interactive scene with orbit controls
